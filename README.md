# Matrix_Engine
HDL Project: Create a Matrix engine in Verilog with an ISA that performs the functions add, subtract, multiply, scale, and transpose on 4x4 matrices.

Given and constraints: Two matrices with numbers ranging from 1-16. Numbers are set so overflow does not have to be taken into account. 256 bits by 16 bits memory is sufficient. 

The exe_tb.v is a testbench for the whole matrix engine. Each module has its own verilog file and a testbench associated with it.
